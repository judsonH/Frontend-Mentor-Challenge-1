## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at a Frontend Mentor challenge, and also my first web page ever.  So I learned a lot.  I was learningn pretty much everything I typed it.  I had seen a lot in tutorials, but I needed to escape tutorial hell and try something on my own.

### Continued development

I used flexbox in this challenge.  I need to develope my comfortablity with it.  I would also like to do the same page, or something similar, with grid.
